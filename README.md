# How in the hell did you get this?

LF, Before it went to shit.

# How do I use this?

Load it up into Eclipse and edit all classpath files to match your libs.

# Notice to Mineplex/GitHub Employees

I consider this fair use. It is in a private repository which only RLME Developers get access to.

We, as RATELIMITED, do not plan on releasing this to the general public.

Thank you very much
