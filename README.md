# EHNetwork Source Code
The following repository is the source code for the EHNetwork. It is based on the All-Mineplex-2015 code leak.

# How do I use this?

Clone the repository and open the folder that all the Mineplex.* folders are saved in in IntelliJ IDEA **ULTIMATE**. You can optionally install the free TeamHub plugin to collaborate with us.

# Notice to Mineplex/GitHub Employees

We consider this fair use. It is in a private repository which only EH Developers get access to.

We do not plan on releasing this to the general public.

Thank you very much
